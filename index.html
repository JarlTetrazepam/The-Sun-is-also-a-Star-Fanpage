                  <p>Natasha is a very practical and logical person, who
                    believes that anything may be proven eventually. To her, if something can't be proven, it cannot exist.
                    She still appears somewhat moony at times, usually when getting lost in thought about the universe.
                    She doesn't believe in the idea of love, until she meets Daniel. Natasha becomes more and more sentimental and content with love,
                    until she is deported together with her family. When they meet again after a long time, Natasha has found her true passion as an X
                    in the US and is ready to be with Daniel.</p>

                    and becomes inspired by Natasha's personality.
                    His parents are very strict and want him to become a doctor, despite his own wishes. He doesn't get along well with his brother Charlie either,
                    they fight a lot and even get physical. Despite this, he fervidly pursues his passion for poetry.</p>

                    In 2018, Choi came out as sexually fluid. In an interview with The Advocate he stated: <br> <i>"I feel like a lot of people understand it better if you just say ‘bisexual,’
                    which is not the same thing, but it's like sometimes when people say, ‘Oh, so you’re bi?’ I don't even want to argue anymore.
                    It's just like, 'Yeah — sure.' I feel like the term pansexual is a little bit closer. With me, I say fluid because it's always changing.”</i>
