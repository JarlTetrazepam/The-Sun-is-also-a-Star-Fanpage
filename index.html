                  <p class="cardTitle">Natasha Kingsley</p>
                  <p>Natasha is a very practical and logical person, who
                    believes that anything may be proven eventually. To her, if something can't be proven, it cannot exist.
                    She still appears somewhat moony at times, usually when getting lost in thought about the universe.
                    She doesn't believe in the idea of love, until she meets Daniel. Natasha becomes more and more sentimental and content with love,
                    until she is deported together with her family. When they meet again after a long time, Natasha has found her true passion as an X
                    in the US and is ready to be with Daniel.</p>

                  <p>The seemingly dreamiest person alive sees the world as a giant stage and everyone has got their role in it. He gets told by a subway driver
                    to wait for a sign of fate, which he promptly does when he sees Natasha. Daniel tries to convince her that both fate and love exist
                    and becomes inspired by Natasha's personality.
                    His parents are very strict and want him to become a doctor, despite his own wishes. He doesn't get along well with his brother Charlie either,
                    they fight a lot and even get physical. Despite this, he fervidly pursues his passion for poetry.</p>
